# Introduction to Algorithms

This repository contains my progress and learning in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms, following a structured roadmap. All code is implemented in Python.

## Content

The repository will be updated with the following topics:

1. Basic Data Structures
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees
   - Graphs
   - Hash Tables

2. Fundamental Algorithms
   - Searching
   - Sorting
   - Recursion
   - Divide and Conquer

3. Advanced Algorithms
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Backtracking

## Repository Structure

Each main topic will have its own folder, and within it, you'll find:

- Python implementations
- Usage examples
- Explanatory notes
- Solved exercises

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pizzerolaa/Introduction-to-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate through the folders to find the topic you're interested in.

3. Read the README.md files within each folder for more information about each topic.

4. Run the Python scripts to see the algorithms in action.
