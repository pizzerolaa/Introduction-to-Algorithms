# Arrays
Array is a special variable where you can save many data. These are used to solve may algoriyhms.
For example, you can know what's the lowest or highest of certain data.
In python an array can be created like this:
```
my_arr = [7, 12, 21, 2, 36]
```
In Python and other languages that Java and C++ the arrays use zero-based indexing, meaning that first element in the array can be accessed at index 0.

### Complexity
Before talking about complexity of arrays, we need to know that have two types of arrays, one-dimensional and two-dimensional, the operatios of each one can vary depending on the specific operation.
**One-dimensional array operations:**
1. ***Accessing an Element by Index:***
    - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
2. ***Inserting an Element at the End:***
    - Time Complexity: O(1) (Amortized)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
3. ***Inserting an Element at the Beginning:***
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n)
4. ***Searching for an Element (Linear Search):***
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
5. ***Deleting an Element:***
    - Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Space complexity: O(1)

**Two-dimensional array operations:**
1. ***Accessing an Element by Indices:***
    - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
2. ***Inserting an Element at a Specific Position:***
    - Time Complexity: O(1)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
3. ***Searching for an Element (Linear Search):***
    - Time Complexity: O(m * n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
4. ***Deleting an Element:***
    - Time Complexity: O(m * n)
    - Space Complexity: O(1)
5. ***Transposing a Matrix:***
    - Time Complexity: O(m * n)
    - Space complexity: O(m * n)
